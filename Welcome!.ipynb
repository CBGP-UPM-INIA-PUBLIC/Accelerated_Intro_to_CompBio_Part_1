    "Linus Torvalds was a Helsinki university student who liked playing around with software and computers.  In 1991 he announced the creation of a new core operating system that he had named Linux. Linux powers 94% of the worldâ€™s supercomputers, most of the servers powering the Internet, and a billion+ Android devices. 97% of managers reported that they will prioritize hiring employees competent in Linux relative to other skills areas.  Linux is particularly suitable for businesses with small IT budgets (like scientific laboratories!!!!). Linux is free to use and install, and is extremely stable and reliable (no blue screen of death!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux Mint 20.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Windows, there are many different interfaces (\"shells\"), distributions, and \"flavours\" of Linux.  Obviously, the shell that is on your Android phone is very different from the shell you are using now (Mint 19).  Note that there are also many different shells for your phone!  Linux will also be embedded in devices like Raspberry PI, your WiFi router, your Smart TV, entertainment systems in your car, and spacecraft.  Linux can be very very small - there are distributions of Linux that will run in as little as 3MB of RAM!\n",
    "\n",
    "Mint 20 Xfce is a very rich desktop interface.  It works like Mac/Windows - drag/drop, left/right click - menu bar (at the bottom of the screen).  The main menu is the green \"mint\" icon at the bottom left.  Applications are sorted based on their general type.  Mint comes with Libre Office, which is like Microsoft Office (but free!), Firefox web browser, and a wide range of basic utilities like PDF file readers, etc.  I have installed Komodo Edit (an editor for writing software) - the icon for this is on your desktop.  I have also set the default keyboard layout to be \"Spanish\".  If you click the spanish flag in the bottom left, you can switch to a US-layout keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main applications you will need to know for the first few days is the *Terminal*.  The icon to start the Terminal is in the icon bar (bottom left of your screen) - a black box icon.  Open that now.  You will notice that the terminal window is slightly transparent - I like it that way, but you can change this if you don't.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"command prompt\" is the \"stuff\" before the flashing white box.  By default, Mint 18 tells you:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    Your current \"location\" in the filesystem\n",

    "\n",
    "    osboxes@osboxes ~/Course $\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocomplete is a common feature in most Linux distributions, and is activated by pressing the 'Tab' key.  Autocomplete is \"smart\" in that it will select either an app (in the context where you need an app) or a file-name (in the context where you need a filename).  Try this:\n",
