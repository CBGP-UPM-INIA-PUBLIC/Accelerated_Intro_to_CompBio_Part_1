Part 1 of the "Accelerated intro to Computational Biology for Biologists" course for the Master's Programme in Computational Biology, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.  This covers the first 2 days (~6 hours) of material, taught by Mark Wilkinson.

This is the basics of the basics, just to get you started!


# WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE THE FIRST DAY

Windows VMWare Player:  https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/downloads/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/16_0 
Mac VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/  

You should download and unzip the Virtual Machine we have created for this course:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1La8Tr3OjuusEJZU270O3rWTJPjUW_iH7

**WINDOWS**:  Start VMWare, and select "open virtual machine".  Browse to the folder that you just unzipped.  Double-click.

**MAC**: After unzipping, there is a file with the extension .vmdk.  You need to start VirtualBox, then follow these instructions:  Open VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine. Click the "Settings" button Click Storage Click SATA Controller Click Add Hard Disk Navigate to and double-click on the VDMK file. Click OK to save the setting.   Now your virtual machine will be using the virtual hard disk I created for the course.
