# Accelerated Introduction to Computational Biology for Biologists - Part 1

Part 1 of the "Accelerated intro to Computational Biology for Biologists" course for the Master's Programme in Computational Biology, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.  This covers the first 2 days (~6 hours) of material, taught by Mark Wilkinson.

This is the basics of the basics, just to get you started!


# WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE THE FIRST DAY

Windows VMWare Player:  https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/14_0 
Mac VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/  

You should download and unzip the Virtual Machine we have created for this course:  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1147435

**WINDOWS**:  Start VMWare, and select "open virtual machine".  Browse to the folder that you just unzipped.  Double-click.

**MAC**: After unzipping, there is a file with the extension .vmdk.  You need to start VirtualBox, then follow these instructions:  Open VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine. Click the "Settings" button Click Storage Click SATA Controller Click Add Hard Disk Navigate to and double-click on the VDMK file. Click OK to save the setting.   Now your virtual machine will be using the virtual hard disk I created for the course.

Once the virtual machine starts, your default password is 'osboxes.org'


## UPM Students - INSTRUCTIONS

Dear Students, 

You will take this course using a VMWare Virtual Machine.  You should do the following:

0. CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON GitHub (this website) if you haven't already got one...
1. Download VMWare Player (if you haven't already got it): https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/14_0
2. You should download the VMWare Virtual Machine that I have created for this course, which is in this Zenodo deposit:  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1147435
3. Unzip the virtual machine
4. Start VMWare Player and select the virtual machine - start it (PASSWORD IS osboxes.org)
5. In the top-right corner of the VM Desktop, you can select either US-style or Spanish-style keyboard
6. Double Click on the "START HERE" icon on your desktop.  after a few seconds your browser should open to the first lesson.
